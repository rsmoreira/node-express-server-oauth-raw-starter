Passport JS

There are only two components you will need to remember about Passport JS components/libraries:

	> Passport
		It is the library responsible to handle the authentication

	> Passport Strategies
		Passport allows you to login at any specific Site that implements the OAuth authenticantion flow, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Github, etc. 

	1. Intalling Passport JS and Google Strategy 

		> Go to your terminal and type:

			$ npm install --save passport passport-google-oauth20

	2. Configuring Passport

		At your index.js file do the following:

		> Import library and Strategy

			_. const passport = require('passport');
			_. const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

		> Configure the Passport with the Google Strategy

			_. passport.use(new GoogleStrategy());
