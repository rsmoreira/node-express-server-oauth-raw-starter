This project will be deployed into Heroku.

Heroku is a Cloud Application Server platform. On Heroku you can easily deploy applications built in Javascript (as Node), PHP, Ruby, Java, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure, etc, and make anyone able to access your code. 

And the better, it is free! Ok, not everything. Whatever, it is good!

Just remenbering: it is similar (si-mi-lar) to AWS.
